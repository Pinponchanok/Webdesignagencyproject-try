This week I learned about CSS Display, CSS float, and How to create a responsive website by using Media queries. I am still confused about it. I want to know if it works on a real phone so I create this.--- It work on my iphone and my desktop but not my ipad.--- I will watch how the instucture do this project and redo this project again.
